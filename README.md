# Password Manager
A simple [password manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager) with Qt GUI and command-line interface using AES-256-CBC encryption via OpenSSL.

## Features
* Cross-platform: tested under GNU/Linux, Android and Windows
* Qt Widgets GUI for desktop platforms
* Qt Quick GUI (using Qt Quick Controls 2 and Kirigami) for mobile platforms
* Interactive command-line interface
* Simple architecture: All data is stored in ordinary files with AES-256-CBC applied. No cloud stuff. Use
  eg. Syncthing for synchronization.

## Covered C++/Qt topics
I've mainly started this project to learn C++ and Qt programming. So beside the mentioned features this project
and the underlying libraries serve as an example project covering some interesting C++/Qt topics:

* Basic use of Qt Widgets, Qt Quick and Kirigami
* Creating custom Qt models
    * Nested model and model with multiple columns
    * Support Drag & Drop in `QTreeView`
    * Support re-ordering in Qt Quick `ListView`
    * Use nested and table model within Qt QML
    * Integration with Qt Widgets' undo/redo framework
    * Filtering
* Android tweaks
    * Create APK via CMake (using `androiddeployqt`)
    * Customize activity
    * Customize gradle project to add additional Java dependency
    * Adjust the window style of the activity
    * Call Java function from C++ and vice verca
    * Show native file dialog
    * Open `content://` URL with `std::iostream`
* Windows specific issues
    * Open an `std::iostream` for files which have non-ASCII characters in the path
* Use of zlib to (de)compress buffer
* Use of OpenSSL for symmetric (de)cryption

Note that some of the mentioned points are actually implemented the underlying libraries
[c++utilities](http://github.com/Martchus/cpp-utilities), [qtutilities](http://github.com/Martchus/qtutilities)
and [passwordfile](http://github.com/Martchus/passwordfile).

## Build instructions
The application depends on [c++utilities](https://github.com/Martchus/cpp-utilities) and
[passwordfile](https://github.com/Martchus/passwordfile) and is built the same way as these libraries.
For basic instructions checkout the README file of [c++utilities](https://github.com/Martchus/cpp-utilities).
When the Qt GUI is enabled, Qt and [qtutilities](https://github.com/Martchus/qtutilities) are required, too.

To avoid building c++utilities/passwordfile/qtutilities separately, follow the instructions under
"Building this straight". There's also documentation about
[various build variables](https://github.com/Martchus/cpp-utilities/blob/master/doc/buildvariables.md) which
can be passed to CMake to influence the build.

### Optional dependencies
* When building any Qt GUI, the library qtutilities is required.
* When building with Qt Widgets GUI support, the following Qt modules are required (version 5.6 or higher): core gui widgets
* When building with support for the experimental Qt Quick GUI, the following Qt/KDE modules are required (version 6.6 or higher): core gui qml quick quickcontrols2 kirigami

To specify the major Qt version to use, set `QT_PACKAGE_PREFIX` (e.g. add `-DQT_PACKAGE_PREFIX:STRING=Qt6`
to the CMake arguments). There's also `KF_PACKAGE_PREFIX` for KDE dependencies. Note that the Qt Quick GUI
always requires the same major Qt version as your KDE modules use.

### Building this straight
0. Install (preferably the latest version of) the GCC toolchain or Clang, the required Qt modules, OpenSSL, iconv,
   zlib, CMake and Ninja.
1. Get the sources of additional dependencies and the password manager itself. For the latest version from Git clone the following repositories:
   ```
   cd "$SOURCES"
   git clone https://github.com/Martchus/cpp-utilities.git c++utilities
   git clone https://github.com/Martchus/passwordfile.git
   git clone https://github.com/Martchus/qtutilities.git                  # only required for Qt GUI
   git clone https://github.com/Martchus/passwordmanager.git
   git clone https://github.com/Martchus/subdirs.git
   ```
2. Build and install everything in one step:
   ```
   cd "$BUILD_DIR"
   cmake \
    -G Ninja \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/install/prefix" \
    "$SOURCES/subdirs/passwordmanager"
   ninja install
   ```
    * If the install directory is not writable, do **not** conduct the build as root. Instead, set `DESTDIR` to a
      writable location (e.g. `DESTDIR="temporary/install/dir" ninja install`) and move the files from there to
      the desired location afterwards.

#### Concrete example of 3. for building an Android APK under Arch Linux
Create a key for signing the package (always required; otherwise the APK file won't install):
```
# set variables for creating keystore and androiddeployqt to find it
export QT_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PATH=/path/to/keystore-dir QT_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_ALIAS=$USER-devel QT_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_STORE_PASS=$USER-devel QT_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_KEY_PASS=$USER-devel

# create keystore (do only once)
mkdir -p "${QT_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PATH%/*}"
pushd "${QT_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PATH%/*}"
keytool -genkey -v -keystore "$QT_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_ALIAS" -alias "$QT_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_ALIAS" -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
popd
```

Build c++utilities, passwordfile, qtutilities and passwordmanager in one step to create an Android APK for aarch64:

```
# use Java 17 (the latest Java doesn't work at this point) and avoid unwanted Java options
export PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk/bin:$PATH
export _JAVA_OPTIONS=

# configure and build using helpers from android-cmake package
android_arch=aarch64
build_dir=$BUILD_DIR/../manual/passwordmanager-android-$android_arch-release
source /usr/bin/android-env $android_arch
android-$android_arch-cmake -G Ninja -S . -B "$build_dir" \
  -DCMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH="${ANDROID_PREFIX}" -DANDROID_SDK_ROOT="${ANDROID_HOME}" \
  -DPKG_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH="/usr/bin/$ANDROID_PKGCONFIG" \
  -DBUILTIN_ICON_THEMES='breeze;breeze-dark' -DBUILTIN_TRANSLATIONS=ON \
  -DQT_PACKAGE_PREFIX:STRING=Qt6 -DKF_PACKAGE_PREFIX:STRING=KF6
cmake --build "$build_dir"

# install the app
adb install "$build_dir/passwordmanager/android-build//build/outputs/apk/release/android-build-release-signed.apk"
```

##### Notes
* The Android packages for the dependencies Boost, Qt, iconv, OpenSSL and Kirigami are provided in
  my [PKGBUILDs](http://github.com/Martchus/PKGBUILDs) repo.
* The latest Java I was able to use was version 17.
* Use  `QT_QUICK_CONTROLS_STYLE=Material` and `QT_QUICK_CONTROLS_MOBILE=1` to test the Qt Quick GUI like it would be shown under
  Android via a normal desktop build.

### Building without Qt GUI
It is possible to build without the GUI if only the CLI is needed. In this case no Qt dependencies (including qtutilities) are required.

To build without GUI, add the following parameters to the CMake call:
```
-DWIDGETS_GUI=OFF -DQUICK_GUI=OFF
```
